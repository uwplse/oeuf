(* mut_induction tactic.  Allows exporting facts about all the relevant types
   from a single proof by mutual induction.

   Rationale: Proving a fact by mutual induction over two or more types
   typically requires proving multiple related facts.  For example, proving `P`
   for all trees may additionally require proving `Pl` for all forests (under
   the assumption that `P` holds on all trees).  However, these side proofs are
   discarded, and must be re-proved after finishing the main proof if they are
   needed.  The `mut_induction` tactic can instead export these additional
   proofs for separate use after finishing the main proof.

   Usage:

   Use `mut_induction` in place of `induction`, and replace the ordinary mutual
   induction scheme with a combined scheme (one whose conclusion has the form
   `(forall x, P x) * (forall y, P' y) * ...`).  The `mut_induction` tactic
   supports the usual `... using ty_rect_mut with (x := ...) (y := ...)`
   syntax.

   Running `mut_induction` will produce the same subgoals as the corresponding
   call to `induction`, plus one additional subgoal which will be used for
   exporting the side lemmas.  Be careful not to run tactics such as `simpl` or
   `eauto` on the final subgoal, as this will break the `finish_mut_induction`
   tactic.

   After finishing the standard goals, only the final "cleanup" goal will
   remain.  Use `finish_mut_induction my_lemma using suffix1 suffix2 ...` to
   export the side lemmas (as `my_lemma_suffix1`, `my_lemma_suffix2`, etc) and
   solve the final goal.  Provide a suffix for each type in the mutual
   induction aside from the one in the primary goal.
