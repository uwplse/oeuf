/*
  Idea: make a region based allocator implementation for Oeuf

  This is intended just as a prototype, to evaluate feasibility of this approach
  
  Operations:
  • new_region(): returns a new region, from which things can be allocated
  • allocate(region,size): returns a pointer to <size> bytes of memory, within the given region
  • free_region(region): deallocates all memory allocated from the given region, and freezes the region (making no more allocations from that region permissible)
  • clear_cache(): munmaps all pages in the cache, letting OS reclaim memory

*/

//block header struct
//in practice this will be followed with space to hand out with allocation

    size_t size; //how many bytes can this block hold (not including header)
    size_t ofs; //ofs = size means full
    struct block* next;
